                        <b></b> The first time that i went to this resturaunt was early 2020 right before covid happened. I was there for one of my coworkers birthday dinners. I remember ordering a medium rare filet mignon that came back perfectly cooked, I also got some seared ahi tuna
                         sashimi that was also delicious. The resturaunt was super clean and the staff were friendly too. Since covid happened right after I wasnt able to go back there to dine in due to the lockdown but thankfully I was able to order from there through doordash a few mor times while 
                         stuck in my apartment. overall I would give this resturaunt a 9/10! everything was really good it was just a little pricey.

                    <p>
                        
                        <b></b> I took my Girlfriend here a few months ago for a date night and we both really enjoyed it. I ordered a salmon dinner with white wine and my girlfriend ordered a lobster role and fries, everything was really tasty. The thing that I loved most about this resturaunt was the view.
                         The sun was setting and we had a beautiful view of downtown saint louis which included the arch, Mississippi river and busch stadium, if there was a game being played you might be able to catch some of the action if you bring a pair of binoculars. 
                         The combination of great food, and a great view made this one of the best resturaunt date nights ive ever been on. 10/10!

                    <h2>"Broadway Oyster Bar</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you love good food and live music then you should definitely try this place out. I took my dad here recently for fathers day and really loved it. He's a huge jazz fan and that night they had a live band playing which he really enjoyed.
                        the fod is great too! I ordered oysters and their "gator tacos" and they both were really good. My dad ordered a seafood boil and he said that was great too. This place has great atmosphere and has heavy New Orleans vibes 
                        this is defenitly one of the better resturaunts that ive ever been too so if you are ever in the downtown area you should really check it out! I give this spot a 9/10.
